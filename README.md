# Elixa
The daughter of the famous Eliza psychotherapist, now she can really chat with you thanks to Python

## Why, what, etc.
Eliza is a program written in 1965 that I discovered about 30 years ago. At the moment, having a discussion with a personal computer was absolutely incredible.
I found a Basic version that I adapteed to my Oric-1 computer and I was fascinated by the simplicity of the program. 

Nowadays Chatbots are quite common, but Eliza is still famous and there are many versions available, in many languages.

With Python it is very easy to implement text to speech and listening capabilities, so I looked for an Eliza version in Python and improved it in a way that you can actually talk to her.

I called this experiment Elixa to keep the Eliza roots and at the same time connect it to Alexa. Yes, this is a very lame pun, but I like it
